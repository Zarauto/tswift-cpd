
State Of Grace@
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room, and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same, oh
And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same
(So you were never a saint, and I loved in shades of wrong)
(We learn to live with the pain, mosaic broken hearts)
(But this love is brave and wild)

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right@
Red@
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright, just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
But loving him was red
(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)

Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
Oh, red (Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
Burning red (Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red

Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red

(Red, red, red; red, red, red)
Yeah, yeah, red
(Red, red, red; red, red, red)
Burning red (Red, red, red; red, red, red)
(Red, red, red; red, red, red)

And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head (Red, red, red; red, red, red)
Comes back to me (Red, red, red; red, red, red), burning red
(Red, red, red; red, red, red) Yeah, yeah
(Red, red, red; red, red, red)

His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street@
Treacherous@
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
Till the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
All we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night and I will
Get you a, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind and I just
Think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I would
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I, I, I
I, I, I
I, I, I

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night and I will
Get you a, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind and I just
Think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I will
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it@
