"Fearless (Taylor's Version)"

There's something 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah

We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly making me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this one-horse town
I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
Oh, oh

Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless
Oh, yeah

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

Oh, oh
Oh-oh, yeah 


"Fifteen (Taylor's Version)"

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
"You know, I haven't seen you around before"

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen

La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la

Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

"Love Story (Taylor's Version)"

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please don't go," and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"

Oh, oh

And I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said, "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'"

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you 

"Hey Stephen (Taylor's Version)"

Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah

Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine
Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you? (Ha-ha-ha)

I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

Ah-uh, myself
Mmm-mm, I can't help myself
I can't help myself
Oh-oh-oh
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm 

"White Horse (Taylor's Version)"

Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

Maybe I was na√Øve, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry

'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now, oh
It's too late to catch me now 


"You Belong With Me (Taylor's Version)"

You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me 


"Breathe (Taylor's Version)"
(feat. Colbie Caillat)

[Taylor Swift:]
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time

Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm

[Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat:]
The music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to

Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
And nothin' we say is gonna save us from the fallout

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

It's 2 A.M., feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
It's 2 A.M., feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh

I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to

I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Mmm)
I'm sorry, (Yeah, yeah) I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Ooh, ooh)
I'm sorry


"Tell Me Why (Taylor's Version)"

I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground, I see who you are

I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doin' to me
Tell me why

Well, you could write a book on
How to ruin someone's perfect day
Well, I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm tryin' to say, oh

I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doin' to me
Tell me why

Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside?
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind?

I'm sick and tired of your attitude
Feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me, then cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love, then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doin' to me
Tell me why (Why)
Tell me why (Oh)

I take a step back, I let you go
I told you I'm not bulletproof
Now you know 


"You're Not Sorry (Taylor's Version)"

All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh

You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know, oh
And now you're asking me to listen
'Cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh

You had me crawling for you, honey
And it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade

So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Woah, oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no 

"The Way I Loved You (Taylor's Version)"

He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says, "You look beautiful tonight."
And I feel perfectly fine

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2 AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2 AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2 AM and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh

Whoa, whoa, oh-oh, oh
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, whoa
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you 

"Forever & Always (Taylor's Version)"

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always."
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always."

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always."
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always."
You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so

Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always."
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said, "Forever and always."
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always."
You didn't mean it baby
You said, "Forever and always," yeah 

"The Best Day (Taylor's Version)"

I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names

I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

And now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today


"Change (Taylor's Version)"

Well, it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this

'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

Tonight, we'll stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah

"Jump Then Fall (Taylor's Version)"

I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa oh, I'm feeling you, baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall

Well I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face, oh
I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it o-over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me

'Cause every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa oh, I'm feeling you, baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall

The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile

Whoa oh, I need you, baby
Don't be afraid, please
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall
Jump then fall, baby
Jump then fall into me, into me

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I shine
And every time you're here
Baby, I'll show you, I'll show you
You can jump then fall, jump then fall
Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah 

"Untouchable (Taylor's Version)"

Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you

Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway

But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And now that you're close, I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

I'm caught up in you
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close, I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, come on
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven
And in the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, oh, come on, come on
Come on, come on, oh, oh, oh

It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
They're spelling out your name, oh 

"Forever & Always (Piano Version) (Taylor's Version)"

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold on to the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
What happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said, "Forever and always"

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
You flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
Oh, oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so, oh

Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Please, back up, oh, back up
Back up, baby, back up


'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
You flashback to when we said forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
You didn't mean it baby
You said, "Forever and always," yeah

"Come In With The Rain (Taylor's Version)"

I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I don't wanna go there anymore

Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far
And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start

Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

I've watched you so long, screamed your name
I don't know what else I can say

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night for all these games
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore 

"Today Was A Fairytale (Taylor's Version)"

Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around

Can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
All that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around, yeah

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale 

"You All Over Me (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"
(feat. Maren Morris)

[Taylor Swift:]
Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do
The way the tires turn stones, on old county roads
They leave 'em muddy underneath
Reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off
It's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket it's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been
Reminds me of me

[Taylor Swift and Maren Morris:]
I lived, and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long
And wasted time, lost tears
Swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your "Don't you wish you had me?" grin
Well, I did, so I smiled, and I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then

And I lived, and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long
And wasted time, lost tears
Swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

I lived, and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around
And see, that we
Were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I cried
And I watched a part of myself die
'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
I've still got you all over me
Still got you all over me 


"Mr. Perfectly Fine (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

Mr. "Perfect face"
Mr. "Here to stay"
Mr. "Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away"
Everything was right
Mr. "I've been waiting for you all my life"
Mr. "Every single day until the end, I will be by your side"

But that was when I got to know Mr. "Change of heart"
Mr. "Leaves me all alone," I fall apart
It takes everything in me just to get up each day
But it's wonderful to see that you're okay

Hello Mr. "Perfectly fine"
How's your heart after breaking mine?
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby
Hello Mr. "Casually cruel"
Mr. "Everything revolves around you"
I've been Miss "Misery" since your goodbye
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"

Mr. "Never told me why"
Mr. "Never had to see me cry"
Mr. "Insincere apology so he doesn't look like the bad guy"
He goes about his day
Forgets he ever even heard my name
Well, I thought you might be different than the rest, I guess you're all the same

'Cause I hear he's got his arm 'round a brand-new girl
I've been pickin' up my heart, he's been pickin' up her
And I never got past what you put me through
But it's wonderful to see that it never fazed you

Hello Mr. "Perfectly fine"
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby
Hello Mr. "Casually cruel"
Mr. "Everything revolves around you"
I've been Miss "Misery" since your goodbye
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"

So dignified in your well-pressed suit
So strategized, all the eyes on you
Sashay away to your seat
It's the best seat, in the best room
Oh, he's so smug, Mr. "Always wins"
So far above me in every sense
So far above feeling anything

And it's really such a shame
It's such a shame
'Cause I was Miss "Here to stay"
Now I'm Miss "Gonna be alright someday"
And someday maybe you'll miss me
But by then, you'll be Mr. "Too late"

Goodbye Mr. "Perfectly fine"
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby
Goodbye Mr. "Casually cruel"
Mr. "Everything revolves around you"
I've been Miss "Misery" for the last time
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"
You're perfectly fine
Mr. "Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away"
You said you'd never go away


"We Were Happy (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night and we were happy
I do recall a good while back, we snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it
And we were happy

When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder 'cause we were happy

When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy
We were happy

Oh, I hate those voices telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices and that's what these tears are for
'Cause we were happy, we were happy

When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me
And we were happy
Yeah, we were happy
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We were happy 


"That's When (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"
(feat. Keith Urban)

[Taylor Swift:]
You said, "I know"
When I said, "I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this"
You watched me go
And I knew my
Words were hard to hear
And harder to ever take back
And I said, "When can I-I-I come back?"

[Taylor Swift and Keith Urban:]
And you said that's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when, I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when
Mm, mm

I said, "I know"
When you said, "I did you wrong
Made mistakes
And put you through all of this" (through all of this)
Then through the phone
Came all your tears
And I said, "Leave those all in our past"
And you said, "When can I-I-I come back?"

And I said, that's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when"

[Taylor Swift:]
And you said, "Honestly
When you were gone
Did you ever think of me?"
And I said

[Taylor Swift with Keith Urban:]
"That's when, when I woke up in the morning
That's when, it was sunny or storming
Laughing when I was crying
And that's when, you were waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I saw your face
You let me in, and baby, that's when"

That's when, when I wake up in the morning (Yeah)
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
When I'm laughing, when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
(That when I miss you, that's when I want you)
That's when, when I see your face
That's when I love you, that's when

"Don't You (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

Hey, I knew I'd run into you somewhere
It's been a while, I didn't mean to stare
I heard she's nothin' like me
I'm sure she'll make you happy

But don't you
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

Ah, ah, ah, ah

Sometimes I really wish that I could hate you
I've tried, but that's just somethin' I can't do
My heart knows what the truth is
I swore I wouldn't do this

But don't you
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

So I walk outta here tonight
Try to go on with my life
And you can say, "We're still friends"
I don't wanna pretend
So if I see you again

Don't you (Don't you)
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you (Don't you), say you've missed me if you don't want me again
You don't (You don't), know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Don't you, ah, ah, ah

"Bye Bye Baby (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
I'm driving away and I, I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray
'Cause I, I still love you but I can't

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, baby

The picture frame is empty
On the dresser, vacant just like me
I see your writing on the dash
Then back to your hesitation
I was so sure of everything
Everything I thought we'd always have
Guess I never doubted it
Then the here and the now floods in
Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye, bye, baby

And there's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want but it's not enough this time
And all the pages are just slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Oh, you took me home, I thought you were gonna keep me
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, baby

"Back To December"

I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while

You've been good, busier than ever
We small-talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying, "I'm sorry for that night,"
And I go back to December all the time

It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call

And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was "Goodbye"

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying, "I'm sorry for that night."
And I go back to December all the time

It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night:
The first time you ever saw me cry

Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right

I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
So if the chain is on your door I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying, "I'm sorry for that night."
And I go back to December

It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind

I go back to December all the time
All the time 


"Speak Now"

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white-veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

Don't say "Yes", run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now."

Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me
Don't you?

Don't say "Yes", run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now."
Don't say "Yes", run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
Your time is running out
And they said, "Speak now."

Oh, la, la
Oh, oh
Say a single vow

I hear the preacher say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace."
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only looking at you

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white-veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

So, don't say "Yes", run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now."
And you say, "Let's run away now
I'll meet you when I'm out of my tux at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows
So glad you were around
When they said, "Speak now."


"Dear John"

Long were the nights
When my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through
Again

And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine

You paint me a blue sky
And go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules every day

Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up, and this song is to let you know why

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed
With?
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home
I should've known

Well, maybe it's me
And my blind optimism
To blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love then take it away

And you'll add my name
To your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret
How I ignored when they said
"Run as fast as you can."

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed
With?
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home

Dear John
I see it all now. It was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young to be played
By your dark twisted games?
When I loved you so
I should've known

You are an expert at "Sorry"
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry
Have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you've burned them out

But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So, don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed
With?
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home

I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed
With?
The girl in the dress
Wrote you a song
You should've known

You should've known
Don't you think I was too young?
You should've known


"Mean"

You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man

Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

But someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah

Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

"The Story Of Us"

I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, "They're the lucky ones."
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on

Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fall-out
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up I can't break through

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

Next chapter

How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me

Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side

The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armour down
If you said you'd rather love than fight

So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
But I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now

...and we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate 'cause we're going down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

The end


"Never Grow Up"

Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up, never grow up

You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to, just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone

So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on

Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up

Oh, I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
I could still be little
Oh, I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
Won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to, please try to never grow up
Oh, don't you ever grow up
Oh, never grow up, just never grow up


"Enchanted"

There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired lonely place

Walls of insincerity,
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face

All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy

And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, "Hey,
It was enchanting to meet you,
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you."

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
(Please don't be in love with someone else)
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
(Please don't have somebody waiting on you)
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
(Please don't be in love with someone else)
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you 

"Better Than Revenge"

"Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did."

Time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you could say "sabotage"

I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress
She's better known
For the things that she does on the mattress

Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things

But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
They wouldn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress
She's better known
For the things that she does
On the mattress

Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him but I always get the last word

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress
(She deserve it)
She's better known
For the things that she does on the mattress

Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do
(No, no, no, no)
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
I don't think you do
I don't think you do

Let's hear the applause
(Come on, come on)
Come on show me how much better you are
(So much better, yeah?)
So you deserve some applause 'cause you're so much better

She took him faster than you could say "sabotage"


"Innocent"

I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin' to get it back

Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Did some things you can't speak of
But at night you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days?
When everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too
Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Lost your balance on a tightrope
It's never too late to get it back 

"Haunted"

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

Oh, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time I'm wishing he was you instead

Oh, holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding on to nothing

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

I know, I know, I just know
You're not gone. You can't be gone. No

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted

Oh

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it 

"Last Kiss"

I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away

I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July 9th
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
I'm not much for dancing
But for you I did

Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips

Just like our last 


"Long Live"

I said remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild

We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew
Our lives would never be the same

You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there
On the side-lines wishing for right now

We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town

And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "This is absurd!"
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves
In ripped-up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Will you take a moment
Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in

And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name

Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life, with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Singing, long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered 

"Ours"

Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now my time is theirs

Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care 'cause right now you're mine

And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

And it's not theirs to speculate
If it's wrong and
Your hands are tough
But they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you

'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours

The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

"If This Was A Movie"

Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
"Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
Not before I knew how much I had to lose."

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

If you're out there
If you're somewhere
If you're moving on
I've been waiting for you
Ever since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just wanna see you back at my front door
And I'd say

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said, "It's not that easy."
Before the fight, before I locked you out
But I take it all back now

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
Baby, what about the ending
Oh, I thought you'd be here by now, whoa
Thought you'd be here by now

"Superman"

Tall, dark and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say

And you smile and say, "How are you?"
I'll say, "Just fine."
I always forget to tell you, I love you, I'll love you forever

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watch superman fly away
Come back I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they say

And you'll leave, got places to be
And I'll be OK
I always forget to tell you I love you, I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world I'll be around
And I watch superman fly away
Come back I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget about me
I'm far away but I never let you go
I'm love-struck and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be
Right here wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you

'Cause I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
Forever and ever here
I watch superman fly away
I swear I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

When you come back down

"I Knew You Were Trouble (Taylor's Version)"

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey

I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Oh)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (Yeah)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh-oh (Yeah)
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Trouble)
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything
Yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (Never been)
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Knew it right there)
So shame on me now (Knew it right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been (Ooh)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Oh)
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Trouble)
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble 

"All Too Well (Taylor's Version)"

I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer even now

Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all, oh-oh-oh

'Cause there we are again on that
Little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were
Looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
You taught me about your past, thinking your future was me
And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah

And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Till you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well

And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well


"22 (Taylor's Version)"

It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Ah, ah, ah, ah
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Ah ah, ah, ah
Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines, it's time
Ah, ah

I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're
22
22

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids ("Who is Taylor Swift anyway?")
Ah ah, ah ah
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping, yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks, it's time
Ah, ah

I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if (Alright)
We just keep dancing like we're
22
22 (I don't know about you)
22
22

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you

I don't know about you (I don't know about you)
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me (You don't know about me)
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're 22
22
22 (Dancing like)
22
22

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you

"I Almost Do (Taylor's Version)"

I bet this time of night you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city and I bet
Sometimes you wonder 'bout me

And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me
Not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't
I almost do
I almost do

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out, there's no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can't say hello to you and risk another goodbye

And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me
Not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't
I almost do, I almost do

Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
It's probably better off this way
And I confess, baby
In my dreams you're touching my face
And asking me if I'd want to try again with you
And I almost do

And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me
Not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't
I almost do, I almost do

I bet this time of night you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city and I hope
Sometimes you wonder 'bout me

"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together (Taylor's Version)"

I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough", 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space, what?
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you"

Ooh, we called it off again last night but
Ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh, you called me up again tonight but
Ooh, this time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

I used to think that we were forever ever
And I used to say never say never

So he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you"
And I'm like, I'm just, I mean this is exhausting you know?
Like we are never getting back together
Like, ever

(No)
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

(We)
No
(Getting back together)
(We)
(Getting back together)
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
(Talk to me)
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together


"Stay Stay Stay (Taylor's Version)"

I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away but you stayed

This morning I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said, "Ok, let's talk"
And I said

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

Before you I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay

You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes and dreams
I just like hanging out with you
All the time
All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you
For my whole life

Stay
And I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

That's so fun 


"The Last Time (Taylor's Version)"
(feat. Gary Lightbody)

I find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I'm not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better

And right before your eyes
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

You find yourself at my door
And just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

And right before your eyes
I'm aching
No past, nowhere to hide
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong
This is the last time I say it's been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

This is the last time I'm asking you this
(This is the last time I'm asking you this)
Put my name at the top of your list
(Put my name at the top of your list)
This is the last time I'm asking you why
(This is the last time I'm asking you why)
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
(You break my heart)
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this 

"Holy Ground (Taylor's Version)"

I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone
And Lord it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Yeah you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

And darling it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We block the noise with the sound of, "I need you"
And for the first time I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you

It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you


"Sad Beautiful Tragic (Taylor's Version)"

Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
And we both wake in lonely beds, different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons
And darling, they all look like me

'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair (Whoa, oh, whoa, oh)

Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up, and for the life of us we can't get back
A beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, beautiful, tragic, beautiful

What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair


"The Lucky One (Taylor's Version)"

New to town with a made up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen

Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh

Now, it's big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you'll make it out alive

And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now

'Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right

Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh

"Everything Has Changed (Taylor's Version)"
(feat. Ed Sheeran)

(You good to go?)

All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
But I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel right

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

All I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

All I know is we said, "Hello"
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed 

"Starlight (Taylor's Version)"

I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night
Never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picks me up late one night
Out the window, we were seventeen and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

He said, "Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way"
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"

Like, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh-ooh, he's talking crazy
Ooh-ooh, dancing with me
Ooh-ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream

(Ooh, hoo, hoo)
(Ooh, hoo, hoo)
(Ooh, hoo, hoo)
(Ooh, hoo, hoo)

Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight (Ooh, hoo, hoo)
Like we dream impossible dreams (Ooh, hoo, hoo)

Don't you see the starlight, starlight? (Ooh, hoo, hoo)
Don't you dream impossible things? 


"Begin Again (Taylor's Version)"

Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song, but I do, I do

I walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is, but I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a caf√©, I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy, but I do

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a caf√©, I watched it begin again

And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I wanna talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past

'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a caf√©, I watched it begin again

But on a Wednesday in a caf√©, I watched it begin again


"The Moment I Knew (Taylor's Version)"

You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that "Baby, I'm right here" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy

Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
"He said he'd be here"

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing (Missing)
And that was the moment I knew

What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

You should've been here
And I would've been so happy

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me, singing
"Happy birthday to you"
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

You called me later
And said, "I'm sorry I didn't make it"
And I said, "I'm sorry, too"
And that was the moment I knew


"Come Back...Be Here (Taylor's Version)"

You said it in a simple way
4 AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself, don't get attached
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant

Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

This is falling in love in the cruellest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away
In New York, be here
But you're in London, and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around

This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

Oh-oh, oh-oh
I don't wanna miss you like this
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Come back, be here
Come back, be here 


"Girl At Home (Taylor's Version)"

Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that

I don't even know her
But I feel a responsibility
To do what's upstanding and right
It's kinda like a code, yeah
And you've been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But, honey, I am no one's exception
This, I have previously learned

So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

I just wanna make sure
You understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up
You chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And, yeah, I might go with it
If I hadn't once been just like her

So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

Oh-oh
Oh-oh

Call a cab, lose my number
You're about to lose your girl
Call a cab, lose my number
Let's consider this lesson learned

Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Wanna see you pick up your phone
And tell her you're coming home
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

It would be a fine proposition
If I hadn't once been just like her 


"State Of Grace (Acoustic Version) (Taylor's Version)"

I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time

And I never
Saw you comin'
And I'll never
Be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

I never
Saw you comin'
And I'll never
Be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real

And I never
Saw you comin'
And I'll never
Be the same, oh

Oh, I never
Saw you comin'
And I'll never
Be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right 


"Ronan (Taylor's Version)"

I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me, waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

"Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years"

I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming "Why?"
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear

"Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray, we'll just disappear
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years"

What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back


"Better Man (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"
(originally by Little Big Town)

I know I'm probably better off on my own
Than lovin' a man who didn't know what he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic

I wish it wasn't 4AM, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, "You know you had to do it"
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

I know I'm probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it was always on your terms
I waited on every careless word
Hoping they might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning

But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now
Talking down to me like I'd always be around
Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
Oh, you never thought I'd run

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye, like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

I hold onto this pride because these days it's all I have
And I gave to you my best and we both know you can't say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would've become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would've been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah, yeah

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye, like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
(Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again)
We might still be in love, if you were a better man
(But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man)
Yeah, yeah
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would've been the one
If you were a better man 


"Nothing New (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"
(feat. Phoebe Bridgers)

They tell you while you're young
"Girls, go out and have your fun"
Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it
Criticize the way you fly
When you're soaring through the sky
Shoot you down and then they sigh
And say, "She looks like she's been through it"
Lord, what will become of me
Once I've lost my novelty?

I've had too much to drink tonight
And I know it's sad but this is what I think about
And I wake up in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me when I'm nothing new?

How long will it be cute, all this crying in my room?
When you can't blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention
And someone else lights up the room?
People love an ing√©nue

I've had too much to drink tonight
How did I go from growing up to breaking down?
And I wake up in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me when I'm nothing new?

I know someday I'm gonna meet her
It's a fever dream
The kind of radiance you only have at seventeen
She'll know the way and then she'll say she got the map from me
I'll say I'm happy for her then I'll cry myself to sleep
Oh woah, oh woah, oh, oh

I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight
But I wonder if they'll miss me once they drive me out
I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night
And I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me, will you still want me
Will you still want me when I'm nothing new?


"Babe (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"
(originally by Sugarland)

What about your promises, promises?
What about your promises, promises, promises? (No)

What a shame
Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah
Big mistake, you broke the sweetest promise
That you never should have made

I'm here on the kitchen floor
You call, but I won't hear it
You said, "No one else"
How could you do this, babe? (What about your promises, promises?)

You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe (This is the last time, this is the last time)
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
(What about your promises, promises, promises?)

What a waste
Takin' down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah
And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent
Your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe

I break down every time you call
We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
We said, "No one else"
How could you do this, babe? (What about your promises, promises?)

You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe (This is the last time, this is the last time)
This is the last time I'll ever call you

Since you admitted it, I keep picturing
Her lips on your neck, I can't unsee it
I hate that because of you, I can't love you, babe
What a shame didn't want to be the one that got away
How could you do this, babe?

You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe (This is the last time, this is the last time)
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe

I'm here on the kitchen floor, you call but I won't hear it
You said, "No one else"
We ain't getting through this one, babe
I break down every time you call
We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
You said, "No one else"
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe

What about your promises, promises? 

"Message In A Bottle (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

I know that you like me
And it's kinda frightening
Standing here waiting, waiting
And I became hypnotized by freckles and bright eyes
Tongue tied
But, now, you're so far away and I'm down
Feeling like a face in the crowd
I'm reaching for you, terrified

'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep
And I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you

These days I'm restless
Workdays are endless
Look how you made me, made me
But time moves faster
Replaying your laughter
Disaster

'Cause, now, you're so far away and I'm down
Feeling like a face in the crowd
I'm reaching for you, terrified

'Cause you could be the one that I love
And I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep
And I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you

How is it in London? (London)
Where were you while I'm wondering (Wondering)
If I'll ever see you again?

You could be the one that I love
And, now, I'm standing here hoping it gets to you

'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep
And I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you

You could be the one that I love
You could be the one that I love
My love
And, now, I'm standing here hoping this gets to you 

"I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"
(feat. Chris Stapleton)

3 AM and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine
Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh

Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of

But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me

You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills

But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

Mr. Superior Thinkin'
Do you have all the space that you need?
I don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy
And I bet you think about me

I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me

Oh, block it all out
The voices so loud, sayin'
"Why did you let her go?"
Does it make you feel sad
That the love that you're lookin' for
Is the love that you had?

Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul
Scared not to be hip, scared to get old
Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free
Was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me

But now that we're done and it's over
I bet it's hard to believe
That it turned out I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And, yeah, I bet you think about me

I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me

I bet you think about me when you're out
At your cool indie music concerts every week
I bet you think about me in your house
With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch
I bet you think about me when you say
"Oh my god, she's insane, she wrote a song about me"
I bet you think about me


"Forever Winter (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
He says, "Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?"
He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity
I call, just checking up on him
He's up, 3 A.M., pacing
He says, "It's not just a phase I'm in"
My voice comes out begging

All this time I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go

He seems fine most of the time
Forcing smiles and never minds
His laugh is a symphony
When the lights go out, it's hard to breathe
I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
Live my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead
I call, just checking up on him
He's up, 5 A.M., wasted
Long gone, not even listening
My voice comes out screaming

All this time I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go

If I was standing there in your apartment
I'd take that bomb in your head and disarm it
I'd say I love you even at your darkest and
Please don't go

I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren‚Äôt around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go

I'll be your summer sun forever
At 3 A.M., pacing
All this time I didn't know
At 5 A.M., wasted
I'd be in pieces on the floor
Forever winter if you go

He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
I say, "Believe in one thing, I won't go away"


"Run (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"
(feat. Ed Sheeran)

One, two, three, four

Give me the keys, I'll bring the car back around
We shouldn't be in this town
And my so-called friends, they don't know
I'd drive away before I let you go
So give me a reason and don't say no, no
There's a chain 'round your throat, piece of paper where I wrote
"I'll wait for you"
There's a key on the chain, there's a picture in a frame
Take it with you

And run, like you'd run from the law
Darling, let's run
Run from it all
We can go where our eyes can take us
Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run

So you laugh like a child
And I'll sing like no one cares
No one to be, no one to tell
I could see this view a hundred times
Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes
So give me a reason and don't say no, no
And the note from the locket, you keep it in your pocket
Since I gave it to you
There's a heart on your sleeve
I'll take it when I leave
And hold it for you

And run, like you'd run from the law
Darling, let's run
Run from it all
We can go like they're trying to chase us
Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run

There's been this hole in my heart
This thing was a shot in the dark
Say you'll never let 'em tear us apart
And I'll hold onto you while we run (And we run, and we run, and we run)

Like you'd run from the law (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Darling, let's run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Run from it all (And we run, and we run, and we run)
We can go where our eyes can take us (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Go where no one else is, run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, and we'll run

"The Very First Night (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

And so it goes
Every weekend, this same party
I never go alone and I don't seem brokenhearted
My friends all say they know everything I'm going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you
'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel
They weren't riding in the car when we both fell
Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture
They don't know how much I miss you

I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

And so it was
We never saw it coming
Not trying to fall in love
But we did like children running
Back then we didn't know we were built to fall apart
We broke the status quo, then we broke each other's hearts
But don't forget about the night out in LA
Danced in the kitchen, chased me down through the hallway
No one knows about the words that we whispered
No one knows how much I miss you

I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you
Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you

I remember the night at the hotel
I was riding in the car when we both fell
I'm the one on the phone as you whisper
"Do you know how much I miss you?"
I wish that we could go back in time
And I'd say to you
"I miss you like it was the very first night"

I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night
Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you
Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you 

"All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "fuck the patriarchy"
Key chain on the ground, we were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now
He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weeping in a party bathroom
Some actress asking me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sipping coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come
And he said, "It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known

It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

And I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes
"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you, too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it

"Style"

Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh, it's been a while since I have even heard from you (heard from you)

I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home
Lights are off, he's taking off his coat, hmm, yeah
I say, "I heard, oh, that you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl."

He says, "What you've heard is true but I
Can't stop thinking about you," and I
I said, "I've been there, too, a few times."

'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style (We never go, we never go)
We never go out of style

Take me home
Just take me home, yeah
Just take me home
(Out of style)

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down (And when we go)
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style


"Out Of The Woods"

Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods?

Looking at it now
Last December (last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (back together)
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided (we decided)
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinkin'

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Oh
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods?

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started cryin', baby, I did, too
But when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out and said, "I'm settin' you free,"
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were lookin' at me

You were lookin' at me
You were lookin' at me

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
I remember
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Oh, I remember

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
(Yeah)
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good

Are we out of the woods yet?

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?
(Yeah)
Are we in the clear yet?
(Yeah)
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good

And people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed
The more I think about it now the less I know
All I know is that you drove us off the road

Stay

Had me in the palm of your hand

"Shake It Off"

I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm

I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying, "It's gonna be alright."

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake

I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm

Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world,
You could've been getting down to this sick beat.

My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like "Oh, my God!" but I'm just gonna shake.
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake

Yeah ohhh

And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (haters gonna hate)
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break (mmmm)
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake (and fake, and fake, and fake)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (you've got to),
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

It's 2 A.M. in your car
Windows down, I pass my street
The memories start
You say it's in the past
And drive straight ahead
You think I'm gonna hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said
I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would
It's 2 A.M. in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you
We're a crooked love
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
Then it makes you turn right back around
I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would
I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I
I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I
I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I
You always knew how to push my buttons (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
You gave me everything and nothing (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
This mad, mad love makes you come rushing (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
Stand back where you stood (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
(I wish you would, I wish you would) (I wish, I wish, I)
2 A.M., here we are
See your face
Hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love
In a straight line down
Guess you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around
I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would
I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would
You always knew how to push my buttons (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
You gave me everything and nothing (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
This mad, mad love makes you come rushing (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
Stand back where you stood (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
(I wish you would, I wish you would) (I wish I, I wish I)
I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I
I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I (I wish you would)

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood (hey!)
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood (hey!)
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin
What was shining? Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me
Where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times
You and I
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood (hey!)
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood (hey!)
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds they last and they last
Now did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you come in my way, just don't
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times
You and I
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood (hey!)
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood (hey!)
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (ghosts, ghosts)
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (hey!)
You say sorry just for show (hey!)
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (hey!)
Hm, if you love like that, blood runs cold
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood (hey!)
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em (think we can solve 'em)
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood (hey!)
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done (look what you've done)
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood (hey!)
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood (hey!)

He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
I thought Heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha (ha-ah, ha)
Wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning (burning) it (it) down (down)
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow (follow) you (you) around (follow you around)
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just (pretend, just pretend) in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha (ah)
In your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
Even if it's just stayed in your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha
In your wildest dreams, ah-ah, ha

Stand there like a ghost
Shaking come the rain, rain
She'll open up the door
And say, are you insane, -ane?
Say it's been a long six months (oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want (oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl
And then you say
I want you for worse or for better
I would wait for ever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait for ever and ever
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl, oh
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl
Remind her how it used to be, be
Yeah, with pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks, cheeks
Tell her how you must've lost your mind (oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
When you left her all alone and never told her why, why (oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
And that's how it works
That's how you lost the girl
And now you say
I want you for worse or for better
I would wait for ever and ever (ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait for ever and ever
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl, oh
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl, yeah
And you could know, oh
That I don't want you to go
Remind me how it used to be
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
And say you want me, yeah, yeah
And then you say I want you for worse or for better (worse or for better)
I would wait for ever and ever (ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait for ever and ever (I want you for ever and ever)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl, oh
(That's how it works) and that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl, oh (get the girl)
and that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl, oh
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl, oh
And that's how it works
That's how you got the girl

Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone
In silent screams
In wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this
This love is good
This love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh, oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh, oh, oh
Ohh
Oh, oh, oh
Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
And I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in the night, only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone
In losing grip
On sinking ships
You showed up just in time
This love is good
This love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh, oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh, oh, oh
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark, oh, oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh, oh, oh
Your kiss, my cheek
I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost
I fell to my knees
When you're young, you just run
But you come back to what you need
This love is good
This love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh, oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh, oh, oh
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark, oh, oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh, oh, oh
This love came back to me, oh, oh, oh

I-I-I, I, I-I-I, I
I-I-I, I, I-I-I, I
I-I-I, I, I-I-I, I
I, I, (I, I)
You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene, and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling, dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out
'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes
And guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run
Baby, I know places we won't be found and
They'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places
I know places
Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run
Baby, I know places we won't be found and
They'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love
Baby, I know places we won't be found and
They'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places
they take their shots, but we're bulletproof
I know places
(I) and you know for me, it's always you
I know places
(I) in the dead of night, your eyes so green
I know places
(I) and I know for you, it's always me
I know places
I-I-I, I, I-I-I, I
I-I-I, I, I-I-I, I (I, I, I)

The drought was the very worst
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
You're still all over me
Like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
There was nothing left to do
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh) Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Said, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh) Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it
The drought was the very worst
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
(Oh)
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
Finally clean
Think I'm finally clean (oh, oh)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
(Oh, oh, oh) Think I'm finally clean


Flashing lights and we
Took a wrong turn and we
Fell down a rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
And spinning out of control

Didn't they tell us "Don't rush into things"?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twistin' around me
I should have slept with one eye open at night

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (Eh, eh)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better (Eh, eh)

(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland

So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone, or so it seemed
But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams, oh
You might also like

[Pre-Chorus]
Didn't they tell us "Don't rush into things"?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twistin' around me
It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind
But darlin'

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (Eh, eh)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better (Eh, eh)

(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
Whoa, in Wonderland

I reached for you, but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end, in Wonderland
We both went mad
Oh

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
Last forever (Eh, eh)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it (Got lost in it)
And life was never worse but never better
Never better (Eh, eh)
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
And we pretended it could last forever (In Wonderland)
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
And life was never worse but never better
In Wonderland

One look, dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast
You play it back
Buttons on a coat
Light-hearted joke
No proof, not much
But you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects
The chain on your neck
He says, "Look up"
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch
But you felt enough
You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love
Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt
He keeps his word
And for once, you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much
But it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night he wakes
Strange look on his face
Pauses, then says
You're my best friend
And you knew what it was
He is in love
You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe, 'round and 'round
And he keeps the picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life tryin' to put it into words
'Cause you can hear in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love
You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love
You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love

We're all bored
We're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better
We're so young
But we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb but we know exactly what we're doin'
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free
We're all here
The lights and noise are blinding
We hang back
It's all in the timing
It's poker
He can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace (ah)
We need love
But all we want is danger
We team up
Then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But honey, most of them are true
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free
Oh-oh
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
So, come on, come along with me
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
The best people in life are free
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing, and
Please leave me stranded
It's so romantic (it's so romantic)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Oh, 'cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle (oh-oh)
But every night with us is like a dream
'Cause baby, I could build a castle (castle)
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

"Look What You Made Me Do"

I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh!)

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams

(Ooh, look what you made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
(Look what you just made me do)
"I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now."
(Look what you just made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
"Why?"
(Look what you just made me do)
"Oh, 'cause she's dead!" (Oh!)

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do


"So It Goes..."

See you in the dark
All eyes on you, my magician
All eyes on us
You make everyone disappear, and
Cut me into pieces
Gold cage, hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Trippin', trip, trippin' when you're gone

'Cause we break down a little
But when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

And all the pieces fall
Right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes

Met you in a bar
All eyes on me, your illusionist
All eyes on us
I make all your grey days clear and
Wear you like a necklace
I'm so chill, but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skippin', skip, skippin' when I'm gone

'Cause we break down a little
But when I get you alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

And all the pieces fall
Right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes

Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes

You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
I did a number on you
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
Who's counting?
1, 2, 3

And all the pieces fall (pieces fall)
Right into place
Getting caught up in a moment (caught up, caught up)
Lipstick on your face
So it goes
I'm yours to keep (oh)
And I'm yours to lose (baby)
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes

Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes


"Gorgeous"

Gorgeous

You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doing, I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much)

Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face (Gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you (but you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room (dark room, dark room)
If you got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts
(Honey, it hurts)

Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have and
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats (Yeugh), alone
Unless, you wanna come along? (Oh)

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)
And I'm so furious (I'm so furious)
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say? (I say)
You're gorgeous

You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You're gorgeous
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (It turns back to sad)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have (What I can have)
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You're gorgeous


"Getaway Car"

No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it
And you didn't see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason

"X" marks the spot, where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lying to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark

You were driving the getaway car
We were flying, but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
We're riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car
No, they never get far
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinking
And I was just drinking
Well he was running after us, I was screaming, 'Go, go, go!'
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain't a love story
And now we're both sorry (we're both sorry)

"X" marks the spot, where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart

You were driving the getaway car
We were flying, but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
We're riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car
No, they never get far
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

We were jet-set Bonnie and Clyde
Until I switched to the other side
To the other side
It's no surprise, I turned you in
'Cause us traitors never win

I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me

Driving the getaway car
We were flying, but we'd never get far (Don't pretend)
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
We're riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart (Should've known)
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car
No, they never get far
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

I was riding in a getaway car
I was crying in a getaway car
I was dying in a getaway car
Said 'goodbye' in a getaway car

I was riding in a getaway car
I was crying in a getaway car
I was dying in a getaway car
Said 'goodbye' in a getaway car 

"King Of My Heart"

I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own
I made up my mind, I'm better off being alone
We met a few weeks ago
Now you try on callin' me "baby" like tryin' on clothes

Salute to me I'm your American Queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do

And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa

And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once

Late in the night, the city's asleep
Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep
Change my priorities
The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury

Salute to me I'm your American Queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
(Inside my room, oh)
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do (Where you do)

And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul, ooh whoa

And all at once (Hey), I've been waiting, waiting (Waiting)
Ooh, whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one
I have been waiting (Waiting), waiting (Waiting)
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once

Is this the end of all the endings?
My broken bones are mending
With all these nights we're spending
Up on the roof with a school girl crush
Drinking beer out of plastic cups
Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff
Baby, all at once, this is enough

And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul (My soul), ooh whoa

And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once
'Cause you're the one I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once 


"Dancing With Our Hands Tied"

I, I loved you in secret
First sight, yeah, we love without reason
Oh, 25 years old
Oh, how were you to know and

My, my love had been frozen
Deep blue, but you painted me golden
Oh, and you held me close
Oh, how was I to know what

I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talking, putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feeling

But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing

I, I loved you in spite of
Deep fears that the world would divide us
So, baby, can we dance
Oh, through an avalanche?
And say, say that we got it
I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted
Oh, 'cause it's gravity
Oh, keeping you with me

I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling

But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
(Ooh, we had our hands tied)
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing

I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again (Again)

Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Oh, yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time (First time, first time)
Yeah, we were dancing (Oh)
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
(Dancing with our hands tied)
Yeah, we were dancing (Ooh)
And I had a bad feeling (Had a bad feeling)
But we were dancing

(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Hands tied, hands tied (Dancing) 


"Dress"

Our secret moments in a crowded room
They got no idea about me and you
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo

All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah

Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
I'm spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and we're both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothing about‚Äî

All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha

Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

Flashback when you met me
Your buzzcut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times, you could see the best in me
Flashback to my mistakes
My rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me
And I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My one and only, my lifeline
I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My hands shake, I can't explain this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah

There is an indentation in the shape of you
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
You made your mark on me, golden tattoo
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

"This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things"

It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year

So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates

This is why we can't have nice things, darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey (Oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence

But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately (Mm-mm)
If only you weren't so shady

This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Yeah)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Nice things) things (Baby), honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have

Here's a toast to my real friends
They don't care about the he-said, she-said
And here's to my baby
He ain't reading what they call me lately
And here's to my mama
Had to listen to all this drama
And here's to you
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face

This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Darling)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Uh-uh) things (Oh no), honey (Baby, oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
(And here's to my real friends)
Because you break them
I had to take them
(And here's to my baby)
Nice things, honey
(They didn't care about that he-said, she-said)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things 


"Call It What You Want"

My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown but it's alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doing better than I ever was

'Cause
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover
Making forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparking up my darkest night

My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck
Chain 'round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say, I
I recall late November, holding my breath
Slowly I said, "You don't need to save me
But would you run away with me?"
Yes (would you run away?)

My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

(Call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
Call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want

"New Year's Day"

There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

Don't read the last page
But I stay when you're lost, and I'm scared
And you're turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore

Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

Please don't ever become a stranger
(To the memories, they will hold on to you)
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)
Please don't ever become a stranger
(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
(I will hold on to you)

"Lavender Haze"

Meet me at midnight
Ooh ooh ooh whoa

Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into
My melancholia
I've been under scrutiny (Yeah, oh yeah)
You handle it beautifully (Yeah, oh yeah)
All this shit is new to me (Yeah, oh yeah)

I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s' shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
Ooh ooh ooh whoa

All they keep asking me
(All they keep asking me)
Is if I'm gonna be your bride
The only kinda girl they see
(Only kinda girl they see)
Is a one-night or a wife
I find it dizzying (Yeah, oh yeah)
They're bringing up my history (Yeah, oh yeah)
But you weren't even listening (Yeah, oh yeah)

I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s' shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
That lavender haze

Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
(Get it off my desk)

Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk

I feel (I feel) the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal (No deal)
The 1950s' shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

Ooh ooh ooh whoa
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
That lavender haze
I just wanna stay
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze


"Maroon"

When the morning came, we
Were cleaning incense off your
Vinyl shelf 'cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
"How'd we end up on the floor anyway?"
You say
"Your roommate's cheap-ass screw top ros√©
That's how"
I see you every day now

And I chose you
The one I was dancing with in New York
No shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was
The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet, it was
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

When the silence came, we
Were shaking blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
Sobbing with your head in your hands
Ain't that the way shit always ends
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
Carnations you had thought were roses
That's us
I feel you, no matter what
The rubies that I gave up

And I lost you
The one I was dancing with in New York
No shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was maroon
The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet, it was
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fuckin' legacy, legacy
(It was maroon)
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fuckin' legacy to leave

The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet
It was maroon
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

It was maroon
It was maroon 

"Anti-Hero"

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices, I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

It's me
Hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out
Slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism
I disguise as altruism like some kind of congressman?
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving and life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)

It's me
Hi
I'm the problem, it's me
(I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it
And then someone screams out
"She's laughing up at us from hell!"

It's me
Hi
I'm the problem, it's me

It's me
Hi
I'm the problem, it's me

It's me
Hi

Everybody agrees
Everybody agrees

It's me
Hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me
(I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Time)
Everybody agrees
(Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero 


"Snow On The Beach"
(feat. Lana Del Rey)

One night a few moons ago
I saw flecks of what could've been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I'm unglued, thanks to you

And it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight, feels impossible
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach

Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, oh

This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen
I searched 'aurora borealis green'
I've never seen someone lit from within
Blurring out my periphery
My smile is like I won a contest
And to hide that would be so dishonest
And it's fine to fake it till you make it
Till you do
Till it's true

Now it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight, feels impossible
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach

Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, oh

I can't speak, afraid to jinx it
I don't even dare to wish it
But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet
Now I'm all for you like Janet
Can this be a real thing, can it?

Are we falling like
Snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight, feels impossible
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around

Like snow on the beach
(It's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down)
Like snow on the beach
(It's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down)
(It's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down)
(Down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down) 


"You're On Your Own, Kid"

Summer went away
Still the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently
He's gonna notice me
It's okay, we're the best of friends
Anyway

I hear it in your voice
You're smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it's your face
I didn't choose this town
I dream of getting out
There's just one who could make me stay
All my days

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared
You're on your own, kid
You always have been

I see the great escape
So long, Daisy May
I picked the petals, he loves me not
Something different bloomed
Writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
I'll run away

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare
You're on your own, kid
You always have been

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes weren't funny, I took the money
My friends from home don't know what to say
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they can't take away
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
You've got no reason to be afraid

You're on your own, kid
Yeah, you can face this
You're on your own, kid
You always have been


"Midnight Rain"

Rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight

My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice

He was sunshine
I was midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight

It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him it's every day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away

'Cause he was sunshine
I was midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight

Rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight

I guess sometimes we all get
Just what we wanted, just what we wanted
And he never thinks of me
Except when I'm on TV
I guess sometimes we all get
Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted
And I never think of him
Except on midnights like this
Midnights like this


"Question...?"

(I remember)

Good girl, sad boy
Big city, wrong choices
We had one thing going on
I swear that it was something
'Cause I don't remember who I was before you
Painted all my nights
A color I have searched for since
But one thing after another
Fuckin' situations, circumstances
Miscommunications and I
Have to say
By the way
I just may like some explanations

Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was making fun of you
But fifteen seconds later they were clapping too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question

Half-moon eyes, bad surprise
Did you realize out of time?
She was on your mind
With some dickhead guy
That you saw that night
But you were on something
It was one drink after another
Fuckin' politics and gender roles
And you're not sure and I don't know
Got swept away in the gray
I just may like to have a conversation

Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was making fun of you
But fifteen seconds later they were clapping too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question

Does it feel like everything's just like second best after that meteor strike?
And what's that that I heard, that you're still with her?
That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable
And right
But tonight

Can I ask you a question? (Can I ask you a question?)
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room? (In a crowded room)
And every single one of your friends was making fun of you (You, making fun of you)
But fifteen seconds later they were clapping too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question 

"Vigilante Shit"

Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man
You did some bad things, but I'm the worst of them
Sometimes I wonder which one will be your last lie
They say looks can kill and I might try
I don't dress for women
I don't dress for men
Lately I've been dressing for revenge

I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don't dress for friends
Lately I've been dressing for revenge

She needed cold hard proof so I gave her some
She had the envelope, where you think she got it from?
Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride
Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife
And she looks so pretty
Driving in your Benz
Lately she's been dressing for revenge

She don't start shit, but she can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
She don't dress for friends
Lately she's been dressing for revenge

Ladies always rise above
Ladies know what people want
Someone sweet and kind and fun
The lady simply had enough
While he was doing lines
And crossing all of mine
Someone told his white collar crimes to the FBI
And I don't dress for villains
Or for innocents
I'm on my vigilante shit again

I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don't dress for friends
Lately I've been dressing for revenge


"Bejeweled"

Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
Didn't notice you walking all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Putting someone first only works when you're in their top five
And by the way
I'm going out tonight

Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, "Do you have a man?"
I could still say, "I don't remember"
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real
I polish up real nice
Nice

Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl
Too good of a girl
Did all the extra credit then got graded on a curve
I think it's time to teach some lessons
I made you my world
Have you heard?
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you
But I miss sparkling

(Nice) Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, "Do you have a man?"
I could still say, "I don't remember"
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real
I polish up real nice
Nice

Sapphire tears on my face
Sadness became my whole sky
But some guy said my aura's moonstone
Just 'cause he was high
And we're dancing all night
And you can try
To change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do?
A diamond's gotta shine

Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, "Do you have a man?"
I could still say, "I don't remember"
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real (Nice)
I polish up real nice

And we're dancing all night
And you can try
To change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do?
What's a girl gonna do?
I polish up nice
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer



"Labyrinth"

It only hurts this much right now
Was what I was thinking the whole time
Breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out
I'll be getting over you my whole life
You know how scared I am of elevators
Never trust it if it rises fast
It can't last

Uh oh, I'm falling in love
Oh no, I'm falling in love again
Oh, I'm falling in love
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around?

It only feels this raw right now
Lost in the labyrinth of my mind
Break up, break free, break through, break down
You would break your back to make me break a smile
You know how much I hate
That everybody just expects me to bounce back
Just like that

Uh oh, I'm falling in love
Oh no, I'm falling in love again
Oh, I'm falling in love
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around?

Uh oh, I'm falling in love
Oh no, I'm falling in love again
Oh, I'm falling in love
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around?

Uh oh, I'm falling in love (falling in love)
Oh no, I'm falling in love again (falling in love again)
Oh, I'm falling in love (falling in love)
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around?

Uh oh, I'm falling in love (falling in love)
Oh no, I'm falling in love again (falling in love again)
Oh, I'm falling in love (falling in love)
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around?

(You know how much I hate it)
(You know how much I hate it)
(You know how much I hate it)


"Karma"

You're talking shit
For the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal but you're relevant
You're terrified to look down
'Cause if you dare
You'll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It's coming back around
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a God
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey
Karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Spiderboy, king of thieves
Weave your little webs of opacity
My pennies made your crown
Trick me once
Trick me twice
Don't you know that cash ain't the only price?
It's coming back around
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a God
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey
Karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade but I'm still here

'Cause karma is the thunder
Rattling your ground
Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter
Karma's gonna track you down
Step by step from town to town
Sweet like justice
Karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit
Karma is the guy on the screen coming straight home to me

'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a God
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey
Karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a God
Karma's a relaxing thought


"Sweet Nothing"

I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
Ooh
Ooh

They said the end is coming
Everyone's up to something
I find myself running home to your
Sweet nothings

Outside, they're push and shoving
You're in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was
Sweet nothing

On the way home
I wrote a poem
You say, "What a mind"
This happens all the time
Ooh
Ooh

'Cause they said the end is coming
Everyone's up to something
I find myself running home to your
Sweet nothings

Outside they're push and shoving
You're in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was
Nothing

Industry disrupters and soul deconstructors
And smooth-talking hucksters
Out glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore
"You should be doing more"
To you I can admit
That I'm just too soft for all of it
Ooh

They said the end is coming
Everyone's up to something
I find myself running home to your
Sweet nothings

Outside, they're push and shoving
You're in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was
Sweet nothing

They said the end is coming (They said the end is coming)
Everyone's up to something (Everyone's up to something)
I find myself running home to your
Sweet nothings

Outside, they're push and shoving (Outside, they're push and shoving)
You're in the kitchen humming (You're in the kitchen humming)
All that you ever wanted from me was
Sweet nothing 

"Mastermind"

Once upon a time, the planets and the fates and all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room at the same time
And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn't lose

What if I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me, nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork and then just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all by design
'Cause I'm a mastermind

You see all the wisest women had to do it this way
'Cause we were born to be the pawn in every lover's game
If you fail to plan, you plan to fail
Strategy sets the scene for the tale
I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails
And the liquor in our cocktails

What if I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me, I knew I wanted your body
I laid the groundwork and then just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all my design
'Cause I'm a mastermind

No one wanted to play with me as a little kid
So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since
To make them love me and make it seem effortless
This is the first time I've felt the need to confess
And I swear
I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian 'cause I care

So I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me, nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork and then saw a wide smirk
On your face, you knew the entire time
You knew that I'm a mastermind
And now you're mine
Yeah, all you did was smile
'Cause I'm a mastermind

"Hits Different"

I washed my hands of us
At the club
You made a mess of me
I pictured you with other girls
In love
Then threw up on the street
Like waiting for a bus
That never shows
You just start walking on
They say that if it's right, you know
Each bar plays our song
Nothing has ever felt so wrong

Oh my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Moving on was always easy
For me to do
It hits different, it hits
Different 'cause it's you

I used to switch out these Kens
I'd just ghost
Rip the band aid off and skip town
Like an asshole outlaw
Freedom felt like summer then
On the coast
Now the sun burns my heart and
The sand hurts my feelings

And I never don't cry at the bar
Yeah, my sadness is contagious
I slur your name til someone puts
Me in a car
I stopped receiving invitations

Oh my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Moving on was always easy
For me to do
It hits different, it hits
Different 'cause it's you

I find the artifacts
Cried over a hat
Cursed the space that I needed
I trace the evidence
Make it make some sense
Why the wound is still bleeding
You were the one that I loved
Don't need another metaphor it's
Simple enough
A wrinkle in time like the crease
By your eyes
This is why they shouldn't kill off
The main guy
Dreams of your hair and your
Stare and sense of belief
In the good in the world, you once
Believed in me
And I felt you and I held you
For a while
Bet I could still melt your world
Argumentative, antithetical
Dream girl
I heard your key turn in the door
Down the hallway
Is that your key in the door?
Is it okay?
Is it you?
Or have they come to
Take me away?

Oh my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
Cause it's you
Catastrophic blues
Moving on was always easy
For me to do
It hits different, it hits
Different 'cause it's you

"The Great War"

My knuckles were bruised like violets
Sucker punching walls
Cursed you as I sleep talked
Spineless in my tomb of silence
Tore your banners down
Took the battle underground
And maybe it was egos swinging
Maybe it was her
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur

All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, sweet dream was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember, uh-huh
Tears on the letter, I vowed
Not to cry anymore
If we survived the Great War

You drew up some good faith treaties
I drew curtains closed
Drank my poison all alone
You said I have to trust more freely
But diesel is desire
You were playing with fire
And maybe it's the past that's talking
Screaming from the crypt
Telling me to punish you for things you never did
So I justified it

All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, the bombs were closer
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember, uh-huh
The burning embers, I vowed
Not to fight anymore
If we survived the Great War
Uh-huh, uh-huh

It turned into something bigger
Somewhere in the haze
Got a sense I'd been betrayed
Your finger on my hairpin triggers
Soldier down on that icy ground
Looked up at me with honor and truth
Broken and blue
So I called off the troops
That was the night I nearly lost you
I really thought I'd lost you

We can plant a memory garden
Say a solemn prayer
Place a poppy in my hair
There's no morning glory
It was war, it wasn't fair
And we will never go back to that

Bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, the worst was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember, uh-huh
We're burned for better, I vowed
I would always be yours
'Cause we survived the Great War
Uh-huh, uh-huh
I will always be yours
'Cause we survived the Great War
Uh-huh
I vowed I will always be yours


"Bigger Than The Whole Sky"

No words appear before me in the aftermath
Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears
Every single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness
'Cause it's all over now, all out to sea

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you
What could've been, would've been you

Did some bird flap its wings over in Asia?
Did some force take you because I didn't pray?
Every single thing to come has turned into ashes
'Cause it's all over, it's not meant to be
So I'll say words I don't believe

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you

What could've been, would've been you
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you
What could've been, would've been you

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you


"Paris"

Your ex-friend's sister met someone at a club and he kissed her
Turns out it was that guy you hooked up with ages ago, some wannabe Z-lister
And all the outfits were terrible
2003 unbearable
Did you see the photos?
No, I didn't but thanks though

I'm so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
Stumble down pretend alleyways
Cheap wine, make believe it's champagne
I was taken by the view
Like we were in Paris
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris, oh
We were somewhere else

Privacy sign on the door
And on my page and on the whole world
Romance is not dead
If you keep it just yours
Levitate above all the messes made
Sit quiet by my side in the shade
And not the kind that's thrown
I mean the kind under where a tree has grown

I'm so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
Stumble down pretend alleyways
Cheap wine, make believe it's champagne
I was taken by the view
Like we were in Paris
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris, oh
We were somewhere else

I want to brainwash you into loving me forever
I want to transport you to somewhere the culture's clever
Confess my truth in swooping, sloping, cursive letters
Let the only flashing lights
Be the tower at midnight
In my mind

We drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
In an alleyway
Drinking champagne
'Cause we were in Paris
Yes, we were somewhere else
My love, we were in Paris
Yes, we were somewhere else 


"High Infidelity"

Lock broken
Slur spoken
Wound open
Game token
I didn't know you were keeping count
Rain soaking
Blind hoping
You said I was freeloading
I didn't know you were keeping count

High infidelity
Put on your records and regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around, dancing around it
High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around, dancing around it

Do you really want to know where I was April 29th?
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?

Storm coming
Good husband
Bad omen
Dragged my feet right down the aisle
At the house lonely
Good money
I'd pay, if you'd just know me
Seemed like the right thing at the time

You know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
The slowest way is never loving them enough
Do you really want to know where I was April 29th?
Do I really have to tell you how he brought me back to life?

High infidelity
Put on your records and regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around, dancing around it

High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around, dancing around it

Do you really want to know where I was April 29th?
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?
You know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
The slowest way is never loving them enough

High infidelity
Put on your records and regret meeting me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around, dancing around it

High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around, dancing around it

Oh, there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
And it's never enough, it's never enough

Lock broken
Slur spoken
Wound open
Game token
I didn't know you were keeping count
Rain soaking
Blind hoping
You said I was freeloading
I didn't know you were keeping count
But, oh, you were keeping count


"Glitch"

We were supposed to be just friends
You don't live in my part of town but maybe I'll see you out some weekend
Depending on what kind of mood and situation-ship I'm in
And what's in my system

I think there's been a glitch, ah-yeah
Five seconds later I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, ah-yeah
And I'm not even sorry
Nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think there's been a glitch, ah-yeah

I was supposed to sweat you out
In search of glorious happenings of happenstance on someone else's playground
But it's been 2,190 days of our love blackout
(Our love is blacking out)
The system's breaking down
(The system's breaking down)

I think there's been a glitch, ah-yeah
Five seconds later I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, ah-yeah
And I'm not even sorry
Nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think there's been a glitch, ah-yeah

A brief interruption
A slight malfunction
I'd go back to wanting
Dudes who give nothing
I thought we had no chance
And that's romance
Let's dance

Glitch, ah-yeah
Five seconds later I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, ah-yeah
And I'm not even sorry
Nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think there's been a glitch
